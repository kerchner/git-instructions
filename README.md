# RStudio + Git for Collaboration and Reproducibility

## Slides from presentation

[Slides as PDF](https://github.com/gwu-libraries/gwlibraries-workshops/blob/master/r-with-git/RStudio_with_Git.pdf)

## Setup instructions

If you already have R installed, skip to Step 2.  If you also have RStudio installed, skip to Step 3.  It would, however, be a good idea to bring your versions of both R and RStudio up to date.

***Attendees of GW workshops:*** If you encounter any problems with these installations prior to the workshop, please contact me at kerchner@gwu.edu and I can try to assist.
